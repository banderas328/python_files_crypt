Hi. Feel free to use my AES file encoder. You can copy, edit , use it for your own and commercial interests. it's 100% free to use .
 but you can't sell it :)

SOURCES 1)
Github repository contains sources in Python language and you can edit it. 2)
 Also you can unzip dist1.1.zip file and use it as simple windows exe programm.
 just run crypt.exe file and follow instructions. it's easy to use . but if you need to use "salt" files you can create it manually.
 the project already has salt files with the name salt,salt1, you can open it in a text editor and edit, it should be simple text files.
  here you can add ONLY!!! 16 characters strings line by line. or 48 characters . not 15,27,31 etc. only 16 or 48 characters length.
i  think its not necessary to write a manual. i think it is  easy enough to use.
