Hi. Feel free to use my AES file encoder. You can copy, edit , use it for your own and commercial interests.
it's 100% free to use .


SOURCES
1) Github repository contains sources in Python language and you can edit it.
2) Also you can unzip dist1.1.zip file and use it like simple windows exe programm. just run 
crypt.exe file and follow instructions.
it's easy to use . but if you need use "salt" files you can create it manualy. its should be simple
text files. here you can add ONLY!!! 16 characters strings line by line. or 48 characters .
 not 15,27,31 etc. only 16 or 48 characters lenght.

im to lazy to write manual. i think it is enought easy to use. but if you have some questions you can ask me at
